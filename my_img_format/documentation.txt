.mld (just a crazy idea)

Format:
    The Basic idea is to start with drawing large chunks of one color then drawing smaller chunks of another color over
    previous chunk, getting more details with every layer drawn.

    .old draws one color at a time, with each color considered as one layer.
    .old draws shapes and/or areas, described with given coordinates, with one color.

    These shapes and/or areas of one color is a layer.
    Layers drawn later will overlap previous layers, resulting in it being visible over previous layers.

    Coordinates are given with Y value/values (row number/numbers) first then X value/values (column number/numbers).
    Coordinates can be given multiple X and Y values. (more in 'Coordinate value types' section)

    Takes one Y value and one X value then starts with next layer.


Drawing order:
    Should be based on amount of visible pixels of color, a color with a high amount of visible pixels
    should have a high priority in drawing order.
    Unsure about: easily described shapes, big area

1.Colors
    All ways starts by defining what colors will be used.
    Drawing order is dictated by the order colors get defined. (first color is drawn first, second is drawn second etc.)
    This means, the first color defined will be the first layer drawn.
    The first color drawn will fill the whole image and work as a background color.
    Because of this the first layer will not require coordinates.
    Can get same color twice. (to draw in small details later, unsure if useful)
2.Resolution is given after colors with width first then height. ex. colors,,1920,1080,coordinates
3.Coordinates
    Multiple values is a group.
    The first coordinates given will describe the SECOND layer. (because first layer does not require coordinates)
    If a group of Y values is given (in the form of ONE Range or Array) and:
        a same sized group of X values is given:
            X and Y values with the same index will be paired. (first X with first Y, second X with second Y, etc)
        a larger sized group of X values is given: (this should not happen)
            X and Y values with the same index will be paired until all Y values have been paired.
        a smaller sized group of X values is given:
            X and Y values with the same index will be paired until all X values have been paired then:
                the Y values left will be paired with the last X value.
    If only one Y value is given, it will be paired with the first X value given.
    If no X or Y value is given, nothing will be drawn. (this should not happen)
    X and Y values does not actually get paired with each other.

Comma (',') to separate values.
/unsure, ignore for now/Double comma (',,') to stop defining colors.

Coordinate value types
    Range
    (start,stop) Parenthesis signifies coordinate value type is a Range.
    A start and stop value separated by a comma (',') will be given inside the parenthesis.

    Array
    [value,value] Square brackets signifies coordinate value type is an Array.
    An Array can contain one or more values and can contain value type Range. ex. [(0,2),1]

    Single value
    !value Exclamation mark signifies that only one value will be given.

Example images:
img1:
#####
#@@@#
#@$@#
#@@@#
#####

img1 code:
#@$,5,5,     //colors and resolution defined
                //fills img with '#' color.
(1,3),(1,3),    //from row 1 to 3: draw '@' in column 1 to 3
5,5,            //in row 5: draw '$' in column 5
end
Final code:
#@$,5,5,(1,3),(1,3),5,5,
